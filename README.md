# It was suposed to be a RPG

## My implementation of A* Pathfinder

There it is... An implementation of A* path finding algorithm in javascript. It find a path between 2 points and return it as an `Map()` of positions.

First made in CPP a long time ago and re-designed for my javascript obssession.

It will be re-implemented and adjusted after the "Boas práticas de programação" grade. I will probly use dynamic proggraming for improvments, but later on.

You can test it at https://pleshw.github.io/a-star-pathfinding/
